## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, security is paramount. This repository serves as a central hub for our DevSecOps efforts, demonstrating our commitment to implementing security best practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Security Practices

We adhere to a set of security practices that encompass:

- **Continuous Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of our applications and infrastructure for vulnerabilities and threats.
  
- **Secure Coding**: Ensuring that secure coding practices are followed during development.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Implementing security measures in our infrastructure code.

- **Access Control**: Managing user access, roles, and permissions effectively.

- **Incident Response Planning**: Preparing and documenting our response to potential security incidents.

## DevSecOps Pipeline

Our DevSecOps pipeline automates security checks and testing throughout the development process, ensuring that security is integrated from the start. It includes:

- **Code Scanning**: Automated code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and adherence to coding standards.

- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Identifying vulnerabilities in source code before runtime.

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Testing the application in a running state to identify runtime vulnerabilities.

- **Container Scanning**: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident or breach, we follow a well-defined incident response plan to mitigate the impact and take appropriate action.
